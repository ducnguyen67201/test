Landing page (scoll down):

Top bar:

Left is your CyberOctopus Security logo. In the middle/right you’ve got simple navigation: About us, Find template, Pricing, More, and a Log in / Sign up button. There’s also a small search box in the header for quick lookups.

Big headline:

“SKIP THE SET UP, START TESTING!” — this is the promise: no fiddly environment setup.

Main action (the big box in the center):

A large input that says “Find your target here…” with a Launch button. You type the tech/product you want to test (e.g., “WordPress”, “Drupal”, “Jenkins”), then hit Launch to spin up the right testing environment/template.

Helper text:

Under the big input it gives examples (“e.g. WordPress, Drupal, Jenkins…”) so people know what to type.

Unsure panel (bottom-right card):

A “Not sure where to start?” contact form with First name, Last name, and Email, plus a Contact us button. This is for folks who want guidance instead of jumping straight in.

Look & feel:

Dark background, high-contrast yellow for the main call-to-action, large typography — it’s meant to be bold and focused on one primary action: type a target and launch.

Next:

As you scroll, the background stays black but new sections fade or slide in softly, almost like panels loading in a command center.

This part shows example templates in floating cards. Example templates are about AI coding templates results snapshots. Then at the end, add 2 action buttons: Try it free or See how it works.

Then:

Headline:"No containers. No set up. No friction."

Below is the sentence: "Reproducible environments that launch in seconds, powered entirely by open-

source software and isolated for responsible testing."

After that is 3 floating cards displaying 3 pricing plans: Basic, Premium, Scale. In each box is the description and price of each plan.

Last:

Headline:"FAQ"

Below are frequently asked questions and answers.
