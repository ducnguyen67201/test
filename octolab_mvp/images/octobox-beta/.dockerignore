# .dockerignore for octobox-beta image
#
# Exclude everything by default, then explicitly include what's needed.
# This keeps build context minimal and prevents accidental inclusion of
# development artifacts.

# Exclude everything
*

# Include only what the Dockerfile needs
# --- Core Dockerfile artifacts ---
!Dockerfile
!rootfs/

# --- Documentation (optional, not needed at build) ---
# README.md is excluded to minimize context

# --- Tests directory (needed for CI verification, but not for image) ---
# tests/ is excluded from build context

# NOTE: The cmdlog scripts are in rootfs/etc/ and rootfs/usr/local/bin/
# and are explicitly included via !rootfs/ above.
# If you modify cmdlog scripts and they don't appear in the container,
# check that they're under rootfs/ and not excluded here.
