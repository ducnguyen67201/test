# Default Deny Network Policy for octolab-labs namespace
#
# Security-first design: deny all ingress and egress traffic by default.
# Specific allow rules must be added for required communication.
#
# This prevents lab containers from:
# - Accessing other labs (tenant isolation)
# - Accessing system services without explicit permission
# - Reaching external networks without explicit permission
#
# Apply after creating the octolab-labs namespace.
