## **Our Story**

> *We started with the question:*

> **Why does testing a CVE still take longer than understanding it?**

For anyone who’s ever tried to reproduce a vulnerability, the struggle is familiar — spinning up containers, fixing dependencies, waiting for builds, and losing hours before a single exploit even runs.

**CyberOctopus** was built to remove that drag.

We believe testing a vulnerability should be as immediate as thinking about it — fast, reliable, and accessible to anyone who wants to learn, experiment, or validate safely.

No containers. No setup. No friction.

Just reproducible environments that launch in seconds, powered entirely by open-source software and isolated for responsible testing.

We’re building a space where ethical hackers, students, and security teams can explore real CVEs without barriers — a place where testing isn’t a chore, but a pathway to understanding.
