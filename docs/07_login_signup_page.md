# Log In / Sign Up Page

## **Layout Overview**

The design is split into two **bold halves**, giving a modern, high-contrast look.

---

### **Left Side (Black Background)**

- A large white **CyberOctopus** logo centered vertically.
- Below it, the brand name **CyberOctopus Security** appears in white text.
- Under the name, the handle **@cyberoctopusvn** is shown.
- A row of **social media icons** is displayed below the handle:
  - Instagram  
  - Facebook  
  - TikTok  
  - LinkedIn  
  - Discord  
  - GitHub  

This half sets the visual identity of the brand — minimal, confident, and sleek.

### **Right Side (Bright Background)**

This is the **user interface section**.

- At the top are **two tabs**:  
  - **Log In**  
  - **Sign Up**  
  Users can toggle between them.
  
- Beneath the tabs are **input fields**:
  - Email  
  - Password  

- A **"Remember me"** checkbox is placed below the fields.

- The **Log In** button is **black with bright-colored text**, making it pop from the background.

- A **“Forgot password?”** link appears just below the button.

- At the bottom, a small prompt:
  > “Don’t have an account? **Sign up now**”

This page combines function with bold branding, keeping user interaction simple and visually distinct.
