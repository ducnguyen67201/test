The design is split into two bold halves:

Left side (black background):

A large white logo.

Below it, the brand name CyberOctopus Security appears in white text.

Beneath the name, the company’s handle @cyberoctopusvn is displayed, followed by social media icons (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Discord, GitHub).

Right side (bright background):

This is the login interface. At the top, users can toggle between Log In and Sign Up tabs.

Below are input fields for Email and Password, plus a “Remember me” checkbox.

The Log In button is black with bright color text — reversed from the background to make it stand out.

There’s also a “Forgot password?” link underneath, and at the bottom, a prompt: “Don’t have an account? Sign up now” - for new users to register.
